def insertion_sort(arr):

    Insertion Sort:
    - Take one element at a time and insert it into its correct position.
    - The left side remains sorted.

    Tips:
    - 'Sort like playing cards' - insert each new card into the right place in your hand.
    - Very efficient for small or nearly sorted arrays.

    Time Complexity:
    - Best Case: O(n) (when the array is already sorted)
    - Average Case: O(nÂ²)
    - Worst Case: O(nÂ²)

    Space Complexity: O(1) (in-place)
