def bubble_sort(arr):
    """
    Bubble Sort:
    - Compare adjacent elements and swap if out of order.
    - After each full pass, the largest element 'bubbles up' to the end.

    Tips:
    - 'Bubble up big elements' like heavy bubbles in water.
    - Optimized: If no swaps in a pass, array is sorted early.

    Time Complexity:
    - Best Case: O(n) (when the array is already sorted)
    - Average Case: O(nÂ²)
    - Worst Case: O(nÂ²)

    Space Complexity: O(1) (in-place)
