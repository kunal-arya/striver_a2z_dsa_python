============================

Problem: Given a non-negative integer n, find the largest integer x such that x*x <= n. This is equivalent to finding the floor of the square root of n.
Platform: LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks
Difficulty: Easy

# PROBLEM ANALYSIS
# ==============================================================================

"""
PROBLEM BREAKDOWN:
- Input: A non-negative integer `n`.
- Output: The integer part of the square root of `n`.
- Constraints: `n` will be a non-negative integer.
- Edge Cases: 
    - n = 0, sqrt is 0.
    - n = 1, sqrt is 1.
    - n is a perfect square (e.g., 25 -> 5).
    - n is not a perfect square (e.g., 30 -> 5).

APPROACH:
The problem asks for the integer `x` where `x*x <= n`. This can be solved by searching for `x`.
- A linear search (brute force) would check every number from 1 to n.
- A binary search (optimal) is much more efficient because the function f(x) = x*x is monotonic. We can search for the correct `x` in the range [1, n].

TIME COMPLEXITY: O(log n) for the optimal solution.
SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(1) for the optimal solution.

# SOLUTION 1: BRUTE FORCE APPROACH
# ==============================================================================

def findSqrtBrute(n):
    """
    BRUTE FORCE APPROACH - Most straightforward solution.
    
    Intuition:
    - We can check every integer `i` starting from 1.
    - We find the largest `i` whose square is less than or equal to `n`.
    - This works because we are guaranteed to find the answer by checking one by one, but it's slow for large `n`.
    
    Approach:
    1. Initialize a variable `ans` to hold the answer.
    2. Loop with `i` from 1 up to `n`.
    3. In each iteration, check if `i * i <= n`.
    4. If it is, update `ans` with the current `i`.
    5. If `i * i` becomes greater than `n`, we can stop because any subsequent number will also have a square greater than `n`.
    
    Args:
        n: A non-negative integer.
    
    Returns:
        The integer square root of n.
    
    Time Complexity: O(sqrt(n)) - The loop runs until `i` is greater than the square root of `n`.
    Space Complexity: O(1) - We only use a few variables.
    """
    ans = 1

    # Loop from 1 up to n.
    for i in range(1,n + 1):
        # If i*i is a potential answer, store it.
        if i * i <= n:
            ans = i
        # If i*i exceeds n, we have our answer from the previous step.
        else:
            break

    return ans

# SOLUTION 2: OPTIMAL APPROACH (Binary Search)
# ==============================================================================

def findSqrtOp(n):
    """
    OPTIMAL APPROACH - Using Binary Search on the answer space.
    
    Intuition:
    - The integer square root of `n` must be a number between 1 and `n`.
    - The squares of numbers are sorted (monotonic): 1*1 < 2*2 < 3*3 ...
    - This monotonicity allows us to use binary search to find the answer efficiently. We are not searching the array, but searching for the *answer* in the range [1, n].
    
    Approach:
    1. Define the search space. Initialize `low = 1` and `high = n`.
    2. Loop while `low <= high`.
    3. Calculate the middle of the search space: `mid = low + (high - low) // 2`.
    4. If `mid * mid <= n`, it means `mid` could be our answer. We store it and search for a potentially larger answer in the right half (`low = mid + 1`).
    5. If `mid * mid > n`, `mid` is too large. We must search for a smaller answer in the left half (`high = mid - 1`).
    
    Args:
        n: A non-negative integer.
    
    Returns:
        The integer square root of n.
    
    Time Complexity: O(log n) - Binary search reduces the search space by half in each step.
    Space Complexity: O(1) - Constant extra space is used.
