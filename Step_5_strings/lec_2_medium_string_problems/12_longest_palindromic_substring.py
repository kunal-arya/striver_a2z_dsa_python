Problem: 5. Longest Palindromic Substring
Platform: LeetCode

# PROBLEM ANALYSIS
# ==============================================================================

"""
PROBLEM BREAKDOWN:
- Input: A string `s`.
- Output: The longest palindromic substring in `s`.
- Constraints:
    - 1 <= `len(s)` <= 1000
- Edge Cases:
    - Empty string (though constrained out).
    - String with one character.
    - String that is already a palindrome.

APPROACH:
1. **Brute Force:** Generate all substrings, check if each is a palindrome, and keep track of the longest one. This is O(n^3).
2. **Dynamic Programming:** Create a 2D DP table to store whether a substring `s[i:j+1]` is a palindrome. This is O(n^2) time and O(n^2) space.
3. **Expand Around Center:** Iterate through each character of the string and treat it as a potential center of a palindrome. Expand outwards to find the longest palindrome. This is O(n^2) time and O(1) space.

    BRUTE FORCE APPROACH

    Intuition:
    - Check every possible substring and see if it's a palindrome.
    - Keep track of the longest one found so far.

    Approach:
    1. Generate all substrings using two nested loops.
    2. For each substring, check if it's a palindrome using a helper function.
    3. If it is a palindrome and its length is greater than the max length found so far, update the result.

    Time Complexity: O(n^3) - Two loops to generate substrings (O(n^2)) and one loop to check for palindrome (O(n)).
    Space Complexity: O(1) (excluding the space for the result string).

    OPTIMAL APPROACH - Expand Around Center

    Intuition:
    - A palindrome is symmetric around its center. The center can be a single character (for odd length palindromes) or a pair of characters (for even length palindromes).
    - We can iterate through all possible centers and expand outwards to find the longest palindrome.

    Approach:
    1. Iterate through the string with index `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
    2. For each `i`, consider it as the center for an odd-length palindrome. Expand from `(i, i)`.
    3. For each `i`, consider `(i, i+1)` as the center for an even-length palindrome. Expand from `(i, i+1)`.
    4. A helper function can handle the expansion logic and update the longest palindrome found.

    Time Complexity: O(n^2) - We iterate through the string (O(n)), and for each character, we expand outwards which can take up to O(n) time.
    Space Complexity: O(1) (excluding the space for the result string).
