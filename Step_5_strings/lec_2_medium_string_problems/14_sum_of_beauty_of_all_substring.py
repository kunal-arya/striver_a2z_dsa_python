# PROBLEM ANALYSIS
# ==============================================================================

"""
PROBLEM BREAKDOWN:
- Input: A string `s`.
- Output: The sum of the beauty of all substrings of `s`.
- Beauty of a string: The difference between the frequency of the most frequent character and the least frequent character.
- Constraints:
    - 1 <= `len(s)` <= 500
- Edge Cases:
    - String with all same characters (beauty is 0).
    - String with all different characters (beauty is 0).

APPROACH:
1. **Brute Force:** Generate all substrings. For each substring, calculate its beauty and add it to a running total. This is O(n^3).
2. **Optimized Brute Force:** We can optimize the brute-force approach by calculating the frequency map on the fly. As we extend the substring, we update the frequency map. This reduces the complexity to O(n^2).

    BRUTE FORCE APPROACH

    Intuition:
    - Iterate through all possible substrings.
    - For each substring, calculate its beauty.
    - Sum up the beauties of all substrings.

    Approach:
    1. Use three nested loops.
    2. The first two loops (`i` and `j`) define the start and end of the substring.
    3. The third loop (`k`) iterates through the substring to build a frequency map.
    4. After building the map, find the max and min frequencies.
    5. Add the difference (beauty) to the total result.

    Time Complexity: O(n^3) - Three nested loops.
    Space Complexity: O(1) - The frequency map will have at most 26 keys.

def sumBeautySubStrOp(s: str) -> int:
    """
    OPTIMAL APPROACH

    Intuition:
    - We can avoid the third loop of the brute-force approach.
    - As we extend the substring from `i` to `j`, we can maintain the frequency map of the current substring `s[i:j+1]` incrementally.

    Approach:
    1. Use two nested loops. The outer loop `i` fixes the starting point of the substring.
    2. The inner loop `j` extends the substring by one character at a time.
    3. Maintain a frequency map for the substring `s[i:j+1]`.
    4. In each step of the inner loop, update the frequency of the new character `s[j]`.
    5. Then, calculate the beauty of the current substring `s[i:j+1]` from the updated frequency map and add it to the result.

    Time Complexity: O(n^2) - Two nested loops. Finding max/min in the frequency map takes O(26) which is constant time.
    Space Complexity: O(1) - The frequency map will have at most 26 keys.
