# PROBLEM ANALYSIS
# ==============================================================================

"""
PROBLEM BREAKDOWN:
- Input: A string `s`.
- Output: A 32-bit signed integer.
- Constraints:
    - The length of `s` is between 0 and 200.
    - `s` consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case), digits (0-9), ' ', '+', '-', and '.'.
- Edge Cases:
    - Empty string.
    - String with only whitespaces.
    - String with a sign but no digits.
    - String with digits followed by non-digits.
    - Integer overflow (greater than 2^31 - 1 or less than -2^31).

APPROACH:
1. Ignore leading whitespaces.
2. Check for a sign ('+' or '-') and store it.
3. Read consecutive digits and build the number.
4. Stop when a non-digit character is encountered.
5. Handle integer overflow by clamping the result to the 32-bit signed integer range.

def strToInt(s: str) -> int:
    """
    OPTIMAL APPROACH - Most efficient solution possible.

    Intuition:
    - We can parse the string in a single pass, keeping track of the sign and the numeric value.
    - We need to be careful about the order of operations: whitespace, sign, then digits.
    - Overflow checks are crucial and must be done at each step of building the number.

    Approach:
    1. Initialize an index `i` to 0.
    2. Skip all leading whitespaces by incrementing `i`.
    3. Check for a sign at the current position. If found, store the sign and increment `i`.
    4. Iterate through the remaining characters as long as they are digits.
    5. In each iteration, update the number by `num = num * 10 + digit`.
    6. Before updating, check if the current number is about to overflow. If it is, return the max or min integer value.
    7. Return the final number multiplied by its sign.

    Args:
        s: The input string.

    Returns:
        The converted 32-bit signed integer.

    Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string, as we iterate through the string at most once.
    Space Complexity: O(1), as we only use a few variables to store the state.
